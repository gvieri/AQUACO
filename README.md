Air QUAlity COntrol

AQUACO is "system" able to collect and share data about temperature, humidity, air pollutants that can be used to monitor the situation both outdoor AND indoor. This can be really useful to people for refresh their air at the best moment to both spare money, have the best air quality and to respect possible rulesets. 

So we are using a Nordic Thingy:53 to get the values and to make available to a PC that will manage the actions.
